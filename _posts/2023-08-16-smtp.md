<h4>Linux SMTP Enum</h4>

Use [smtp-enum.rb](https://github.com/ST4RGUARD/OSCP/tree/master/info_gathering/smtp-enum.rb) to check smtp ports on targets

can run against a target range or single target ,multiple hosts , multiple commands and ports

wrote the script with concurrent-ruby using thread pools, should be fast

<h3>$ smtp-enum.rb -x VRFY,EXPN -t 192.168.90.143 -U "/root/users.txt" -p 25,114</h3>

<h4>Windows SMTP Enum</h4>

TestNetConnection does not allow interaction with port 25

we can try to install the MS telenet version

    > dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetClient
<h3>NOTE: Telnet requires ADMIN - if we do not have privs - we can copy TELNET binary on a diff machine c:\windows\system32\telnet.exe to current system</h3>

    > telnet 192.168.50.8 25
