## GDB - debug symbols

## gdb debug symbols

*Notes and material referenced from SecurityTube GDB Primer*

This section gives various information about the variables, functions,
etc in a binary that can be read by the debugger. We will go over
compiling source code with gdb debug symbols, what this allows to be
read, as well as adding to, and stripping symbols from, a binary.

-   can be part of the binary or a separate file
-   **gcc -ggdb** to compile with debug symbols for gdb

![gdb info variables](/images/gdbinfovar.png)

-   **list** will drop us to the main function if it has the source
    available
-   **list 3** will take you to that line of the source
-   **info variables** if compiled with dbg symbols will display found
    variables under defined for the source file
-   if not compiled with symbols or source not available, the variables
    may be found and listed under non-debugging symbols
-   **info scope functionName** will provide local variables

![gdb info functions](/images/gdbsymbols.png)

-   here we use info functions to display all functions found in the
    source with debug options given at compile time

## stripping debug symbols

-   **objcopy –only-keep-debug binary dstfile** used to strip debug
    symbols from a binary & save symbols to file
-   **strip –strip-debug binary** used to strip symbols from binary -
    use **–strip-uneeded** to provide only enough to load binary (less
    information)

## adding debug symbols

-   **symbol-file symbols** used to add debug symbols file to binary
    without symbols at runtime in **gdb**
-   **objcopy –add-gnu-debuglink=debug\_symbols binary** used to add
    debug symbols to stripped binary where **debug\_symbols** is the
    symbols file, and **binary** is the stripped binary
