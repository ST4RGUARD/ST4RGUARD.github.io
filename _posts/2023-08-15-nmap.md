<h2> Linux Port Scanning </h2>

default nmap scan checks 1000 most popular ports

all tcp ports below

    $ nmap -p 1-65535 192.168.120.10

SYN or stealth scan looks for SYN-ACK but does not complete 3way handshake

this is a faster more effecient scan and will not appar in application logs

    $ nmap -sS 192.168.120.10

CONNECT scan is a 3way hanshake, takes longer but can infer more information

    $ nmap -sT 192.168.120.10

UDP scan

    $ nmap -sU 192.168.120.10

TCP & UDP

    $ nmap -sU -sS 192.168.120.10

When scanning many hosts we can start with a network sweep to narrow the IP range down

    $ nmap -sn 192.168.120.1-255

Grep can be easier with the built-in command

    $ nmap -v -sn 192.168.120.1-255 -oG ips.txt
    $ grep 'Up' ips.txt | cut -d' ' -f2

Once ips are listed in script

    $ for ip in $(cat ips.txt); do sudo nmap -sT -O $ip --osscan-guess; done

Looking for specific ports like open web ports

    $ nmap -p 80 192.168.120.1-255 -oG web_ports.txt
    $ grep 'open' web_ports.txt | cut -d' ' -f2

Top Ports can scan ips looking at just the top most commonly exposed ports

this uses the /usr/share/nmap/nmap-services file

    $ nmap -sT -A --top-ports=20 192.168.120.1-255 top_ports.txt

OS fingerprint - osscan-guess will return a guess even if not correct

    $ sudo nmap -O 192.168.120.1 --osscan-guess

After OS fingerprinting, we grab banners with -A which will run scripts to enumerate services

    $ nmap -sT -A 192.168.120.1

    "Banners can be modified to mislead attackers"

nse-scripts can be used to run user created specific scripts with nmap that can also help fingerprint the OS

    $ nmap --script http-headers 192.168.120.1

<h2> Windows Port Scanning </h2>

In PowerShell we can use Test-NetConnection to check TCP ports

    > Test-NetConnection -Port 445 192.168.120.1

we can write a command line loop to iterate through the ports

    > 1..1024 | % {echo ((new-object Net.Sockets.TcpClient).Connect("10.0.0.100",$_)) "Port $_ is open!"} 2>$null
