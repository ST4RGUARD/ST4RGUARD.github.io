if we cannot use nmap netcat may be available on a system and we can use it for port scanning

we can use a TCP 3 way CONNECT scan to look for an ACK packet to inform us if the port is open

TCP scan with a 1 sec timeout on ports 1500-1520 -z for zero I/O to not send data

`$ nc -zv 192.168.5.10 1500-1520 2>&1 | grep 'open'`

UDP port scanning can be unreliable as packets can be dropped by firewalls and routers, and ports may report as open that are in fact closed. Using a protocol specific UDP port scanner may provide better results.

    $ nc -nv -z -w 1 -u 192.168.5.10 110-120 2>&1 | grep 'open'
