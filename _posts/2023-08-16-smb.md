<h4>Linux SMB Enum</h4>

Using Nmap to scan Netbios ports (quicker to isolate ips first with a sweep)

    $ nmap -v -p 139,445 -oG smb.txt 192.168.50.1-254

Nbtscan to isolate netbios ports and provide NetBios server and user information

    $ sudo nbtscan -r 192.168.50.0/24

<h3>$ enum4linux -a 191.168.228.50</h3>

many useul nse scripts in /usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb* 

smb-os-discovery script requires SMBv1 to be enabled on the target system

while the returned OS may not be exact, there can be useful information given such as

OS, Domain Name, NetBios Name, Computer Name

[smb-check-vulns.rb](https://github.com/ST4RGUARD/OSCP/blob/master/info_gathering/smb-check-vulns.rb)

smb-check-vulns was removed, this ruby script will try all smb nse vuln scripts

<h4>Windows SMB Enum</h4>

net view is great at enumerating shares and resources on a client domain 

    > net view \\dc01 /all
